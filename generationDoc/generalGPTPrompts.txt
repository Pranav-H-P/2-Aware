====================
> I'm making a game set in a sci fi setting where there is an interplanetary war against aliens, I want to generate some stock NPC voicelines. These lines must be over the top hyper-militaristic or parodies inspired from various space warfare titles from pop fiction. (Such as Halo, Warhammer 40K, or any other franchise). Do not plagiarize, but make parodied versions or similar sounding lines. All of the lines will be delivered by NPC no-name soldiers, either as background lines or when the main character interacts (one sided, the character walks up and presses the talk button). The main character is a typical one man army super space soldier. I want them to be references. Less corny please. More grimdark, less corny, more braindead

output gave a few lines, I cherrypicked and added a few more

> Generate gdscript code to implement a markov chain

got working code

To generate training text for markov chain
===============
copy pasted the "navy seals copypasta" but Warhammer 40K edition, added prompt 
> modify this copypasta by replacing the swearing with milder words.
> slightly modify the lines so that there would be no copyright infringement, kind of like how meet the spartans parodies 300 without infringing on copyright

got satisfactory output

> Similarly for the "from the moment I understood the weakness of my flesh, it disgusted me" copypasta

got satisfactory output

Also appended few lines of my own and other npc lines

====================
for code completion, also used copilot to auto complete certain lines in the
