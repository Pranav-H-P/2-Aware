Glitch in the system (Not gonna go into detail, there's a story)

## Installation Instructions

#### Alternatively, you can play it on the web

. you'll have to open your browser in fullscreen though


You may receive a "unrecognized application" alert from windows defender with the windows exe, but that's because I do not have a licensed 3rd party certificate (expensive)
