# 2 Aware

## Description

A 2D - retro style twin stick shooter. Fast paced action with a little touch of story.

Fight for humanity's place among the stars. A short and action packed run and gun adventure. 

Or at least that's what the Devs say.

You may receive a "unrecognized application" alert from windows defender, but that's because Godot does not sign the exported executable by default. (and I don't have a Microsoft authorized key yet)
